# Bury St Edmunds

This simulation includes a representation of the lines between Haughley Jn (Ipswich), Coldham Jn (Cambridge) and Ely Dock Jn (Ely).
Passenger services are rather sparse, with an hourly service between Ipswich and Cambridge and a service every two hours between Ipswich and Peterborough (via Ely).
The line is still plenty busy though, being the main route for freight trains to and from Felixstowe and Harwich Ports.


## Simulation

The timetable included is for January 5th, 2022, including all passenger and freight services scheduled that day, although some of these services may not actually run in reality.

## Operational Tips

* As the exits to Ely and Cambridge are single track, make sure to set the routes plenty in advance to make sure trains don't unexpectedly block the line!
* The vast majority of the line has multiple speed limits in real life, with a higher limit for passenger services than freight. Only the higher speed limit has been included in the timetable, so the freight services often run ahead of schedule.
* Don't be afraid to hold trains at red signals to await their slots along the single track sections!
* Take care with the level crossing at Dullingham!
